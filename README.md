Welcome to the Git repository for **Create Your Frisk - Asterisk Mod**, a fork of [**Unitale**](https://github.com/lvk/Unitale/) by lvk and [CreateYourFrisk](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk) by RhenaudTheLukark!

When testing, you'll want to load the Disclaimer scene from the Scenes folder.

Editing the Overworld requires **Unity** (see **Unity Version** below).
